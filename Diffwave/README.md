# Generate respiratory samples with audio diffusion model

## Generate Sound Data


### 1. Download ICBHI lung Sound Data 
We provide the ICBHI respiratory sound dataset we used in this project.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hycczKL1k_nCps0ARUFhqxYSqDE30ocm/view?usp=sharing

This version has
unzip the file and put it in the directory.  
Sound Data should be located in
```
Adversarial-Adaptation-Synthetic-Respiratory-Sound-Data/Diffwave/dataset/
```
it might be like this.
```
Adversarial-Adaptation-Synthetic-Respiratory-Sound-Data/Diffwave/dataset/wav_4secs_16000/...
```

### Preprocess 
```
Note that you can skip ```Preprocess``` if you download the dataset via aforementioned google drive link
```

Pre-process waveform to Mel-spectrogram.  
(not necessary. the spectrogram files already exists in the dataset we provide.)
```
python preprocess.py dir [YOUR_SOUND_DATA_DIR] 
```

### Run Diffwave training
```
cd Diffwave
sh ./scripts/train_1msteps_icbhi.sh
```

### Model
We offer 1M step model we made. This is only 30MB. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LU3pKDHc85bSkQ_BZH5ZTxsCGsOHyXnS/view?usp=sharing  

Model should be located in
```
Adversarial-Adaptation-Synthetic-Respiratory-Sound-Data/Diffwave/save/1msteps_icbhi_Diffwave/
```
for inference.

### Inference


If you want to generate some of the Mel-spectrograms in the folder using command lines, do

```
python inference.py [YOUR_MODEL_PATH] --spectrogram_path [Spectrograms_PATH]
# [YOUR_MODEL_PATH] directory should contain train_args.json
# [Spectrograms_PATH] directory should contain the preprocessed spectorgrams you want to synthesize 
```

Or, if you have followed our guidelines (moved to weights.pt into ./save/1msteps_icbhi_Diffwave/), you can use our script files.

If you want to generate the samples in a specific folder (here, ./samples/test_set_samples/), do
```
sh ./scripts/eval_1msteps_for_generate_direct.sh
```

You can obtain the generated 10 samples of the ICBHI test set (event level) in the ``` ./samples/generated_test_samples/save/1msteps_icbhi_Diffwave_seed=0/```

If you want to generate 2,000 samples from label3's training data, do the following
```
sh ./scripts/eval_1msteps_for_generate_label3.sh
```

If you want to generate 10,000 samples from label2's training data, you can modify the ```iter_for_generate=10000``` of the  ```./scripts/eval_1msteps_for_generate_label2.sh``` file.

In script files, you can modify the hyperparameters.

```iter_for_generate```: how many samples do you want to generate
